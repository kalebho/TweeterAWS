# TweeterAWS

This is an application that resembles a social media platform with the ability to follow users and make posts. The original structure of the project was previously created by the Brigham Young University Computer Science Department. I added code to implement a database that changes with adding users and making posts. I also refactored code by implementing several design principles to better reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Design Principles Used

-Template Method Pattern

-Observer Pattern

-Singleton Pattern

-Dependency Inversion
